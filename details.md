# Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions

## Atton

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| CON | 14 → 12 |
| CHA | 12 → 15 |

### Explanation
Atton gains one more attribute point to bring CHA from 14 to 15, because he’s short 2 from what would’ve been character creation.

## Bao-Dur

### Feats
|||
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Change | Improved Gear Head → Gear Head |
| Remove | Flurry                         |
| Remove | Critical Strike                |

### Explanation
Bao-Dur has too many feats for his level, so several are removed.

## Disciple

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------| 
| STR | 14 → 12 |
| DEX | 16 → 14 |
| INT | 10 → 15 |
| WIS | 10 → 15 |
| CHA | 14 → 8  |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Computer Use | 0 → 3 |
| Treat Injury | 8 → 3 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|--------------------|
| Remove | Close Combat       |
| Remove | Improved Toughness |
| Remove | Rapid Shot         |
| Add    | Empathy            |
| Add    | Finesse: Melee     |

### Explanation
Disciple needs a bit of a general rework. His class is Soldier, and while I understand why Obsidian made it that way and have decided to keep it, a typical soldier’s statline doesn’t really fit what he does as a pseudo-spy/historian. He’s Jedi-trained but that was years in the past; he’s a well-educated, erudite student at this point, not Buff McLargehuge as his vanilla statline implies.

One feat he shouldn’t have had for his level has been removed, and his feats have also been reshuffled somewhat: he loses Improved Toughness down to regular Toughness, to represent the years since he’s been Jedi-trained, and in return granted him Empathy—this is a thematic mod, after all, and even though it’s far from optimal the Disciple’s intense and consistent empathy for the Jedi is a major plot point. He additionally loses Close Combat in exchange for Finesse: Melee, to make his higher DEX a bit more inherently viable.

His attributes were also reworked to reflect his erudition and intuition, which even Kreia praises (when she doesn’t uncritically praise anyone else but the Exile in the entire game!). Some of his physical capabilities remain, because he’s clearly a field agent, but he’s no longer presented as a himbo. He’s got training, but his most fertile field is the mind, not the body.

## G0-T0

### Statistics
|||
|-----|--------|
| STR | 10 → 8 |

### Explanation
G0-T0 has too many feats, and his attributes are ludicrously inflated, but in his case aside from STR I’m not taking anything away from him; he needs all the help he can get as a party member.

---

## Handmaiden

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| CHA | 14 → 13 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Stealth      | 5 → 2 |
| Awareness    | 8 → 3 |
| Treat Injury | 8 → 2 |

### Explanation
I agree with all of her vanilla attributes, except she had one more attribute point than she should’ve at her level. Her skills, however, are a different story. For a Soldier of her INT, she should have a total of 9 skill points. Instead, she has 27. She gets savaged a bit here, because I do agree that, thematically, she needs some stealth. Handmaiden’s starting sustain takes a beating because of the Treat Injury reduction, but there’s still potential in there, especially with the Jedi conversion.

## Hanharr

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| STR | 20 → 18 |
| CON | 20 → 18 |

### Skills
|||
|-------------|-------|
| Repair      | 4 → 0 |
| Demolitions | 6 → 4 |
| Stealth     | 0 → 3 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Remove | Close Combat                                        |
| Add    | Toughness                                           |
| Change | Armor Proficiency: Heavy → Armor Proficiency: Light |

### Explanation
Wow Hanharr, why do you have vanilla Zaalbar’s attribute line?

Even though it’s just ripped from K1, Hanharr has a very inflated statline for his level, but it isn’t quite so simple as that. Part of that needs to be understood as compensation for not receiving Mira, who can be made a Jedi; part is compensation for not being able to equip body armor; and part is because Wookiees don’t have normal human physical limitations.

The balance on this was difficult to do in a thematically consistent way, but I set a baseline rationale that Wookiees would most logically have a +2 STR/+2 CON racial bonus, and the “price” for that was the inability to wear armor in exchange. Proceeding from that baseline assumption, Hanharr’s STR and CON have been reduced from 20 to 18 in both cases, which now leaves him at a normal starting attribute line (plus the +1 attribute selection at level 4, which he starts at) when factoring in the assumed +2 STR/+2 CON racial bonus. His skills are also slightly reshuffled, primarily to give him the stealth he must’ve had as a shadowlands hunter.

He has lost Close Combat and gained Toughness both because I believe this better fits his character (Hanharr is never shown to use ranged weapons, after all) and because otherwise he would come at level 4 with two feats that could only be selected at level 4 (Improved Power Attack and Close Combat). This way he starts with only feats he could have actually selected at his level.

## HK-47

### Statistics
|||
|-----------------|---------|
| CON             | 10 → 11 |
| CHA             | 10 → 14 |
| Vitality (Base) | 66 → 72 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Computer Use | 0 → 3 |
| Demolitions  | 5 → 7 |
| Awareness    | 5 → 6 |
| Repair       | 6 → 8 |
| Security     | 0 → 3 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|----------------------|
| Remove | Power Blast          |
| Add    | Sniper Shot          |
| Add    | Improved Sniper Shot |

### Explanation
HK, HK. What in the world to do with HK. His default attributes are actually inflated significantly, but almost all of that inflation is in categories which are useless for a droid, primarily strength. Everything else about him, though, is underbaked: he lacks one feat due to the vanilla bug which flips combat and expert droid feat gain; his base vitality is lower than it should be for his class; and he’s a full 11 skill points short of what his total should be!

This is a thematic mod, not a “make everybody good at what they do” mod, and HK is where I had to be the most judicious with this. He SHOULD be strong—he doesn’t have human limitations—and as he’s a rusted up old pile of bolts you just soldered back together for the possibly fifth time in as many years, his CON is also probably not that great. Yet at the same time it would be remiss to make HK even less serviceable as a companion.

I decided that, like Hanharr, I would treat HK as if he had an inherent racial bonus: a +6 to STR for being a bipedal combat-model droid. It’s realistic that he should be that strong, even if it’s not actively usable for him. Proceeding from here, I allocated some of the extra points that gave to CHA—yes, also useless for a droid, but very fitting for HK, and not just because haha funny; he’s shown to be incredibly charismatic when he unites the HK-51s at the end of the game. One point is left over from HK’s level 4 level-up, and this I allocated to CON as a sort of olive branch; when the player levels him up to level 8, they can at least get him to 12 CON with his next attribute bonus.

However, I did what I could elsewhere to make him more serviceable. With his extra feat, I replaced Power Blast with Improved Sniper Shot, which is much more accurate to HK’s behavior as an assassin droid and also synergizes with his lategame unique equipment in TSLRCM. I also put his base vitality back where it should be so he has more health than he would in vanilla even without additional CON, and improved all of his skills, but with special focus on Repair so he can more easily keep himself in the fight.

## Kreia

### Statistics
|||
|-----------------|---------|
| DEX             | 16 → 12 |
| CON             | 16 → 14 |
| Vitality (Base) | 27 → 18 |
| Force (Base)    | 0 → 24  |

### Skills
|||
|----------|-------|
| Stealth  | 5 → 6 |
| Security | 0 → 3 |

### Explanation
Pa told me Kreia had to be taken out behind the barn. She’s my waifu, I’ll do it.

No but in seriousness, Kreia is much too strong. I was slightly torn about how to handle this, because her being so strong is one of the foremost indications that her past isn’t quite what it seems, but I ultimately decided that balance concerns, especially on Peragus and Telos, have to trump story implications at least in the main module of this mod. As such, Kreia got weedwhacked: attributes knocked down to what they should be for a level 3 consular, and her bonus base vitality nixed. I did allow her to keep one additional feat she shouldn’t technically have had (class skill: stealth) because she has a unique Force ability related to it, but other than that she is now perfectly in line with what a level 3 consular should have, stat-wise.

## Mandalore

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| CON | 15 → 14 |
| WIS | 12 → 14 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Demolitions  | 0 → 2 |
| Treat Injury | 9 → 5 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Remove | Toughness                            |
| Remove | Weapon Specialization: Blaster Rifle |

### Explanation
Canderous is a bit of another casualty of the thematic nature of this mod. He talks about his body slowing down and his process of getting more introspective in his old age, and while his stat line here sort of reflects that, it’s not perfect. Canderous in KOTOR, before the confrontation with Jagi and his doubts about the future of the Mandalorians and his own personal lust for war, has more WIS than he does now! His CON also increased between games, despite talking about how much he’s starting to rely on his implants!

To simulate his aging, I took his CON down by 1 level and applied the overage to WIS. He also has two more feats than he should have, one of which I used on removing Toughness, to further represent his problems—perceived or real—with his aging. The other was a reduction of Weapon Specialization: Blaster Rifle to Weapon Focus, just to make the feat count proper.

Finally, just for some basic consistency, I gave him the same starting demolition skill he had in the original game.

## Mira

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| STR | 10 → 14 |
| INT | 14 → 12 |
| CON | 12 → 13 |
| WIS | 11 → 12 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Computer Use | 8 → 6 |
| Demolitions  | 8 → 6 |
| Stealth      | 0 → 2 |
| Awareness    | 8 → 6 |
| Repair       | 8 → 5 |

### Explanation
For some reason I’m unaware of, Mira had Mission’s attributes from the original game, copied exactly. This shorted Mira pretty significantly; Mission herself is short on attributes, and Mira also didn’t get the attribute she should’ve at level 4.

To remedy this and better represent Mira’s character, her Strength was pulled up to a respectable amount, and her level 4 attribute was considered to have been spent on CON—she is a rough-and-tumble bounty hunter, after all; no match for Hanharr, perhaps, but still a fighter. Her INT was reduced slightly, and some skills were reduced to make up the difference and to give her a basic stealth capability (again, effective bounty hunter). Finally, to represent her mercy to her targets and her desire not to kill, she was given a small WIS boost up to a +1 modifier.

## T3-M4

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Computer Use | 6 → 5 |
| Repair       | 6 → 5 |
| Security     | 6 → 4 |

### Explanation
T3 has just slightly more skill points than he should for being level 3 at the start of the game—four, to be precise. It’s a minor enough fix, and actually will help with balance long-term: if the player finishes their repair cycles on T3 early, he quickly gains more skill points per level than it’s possible for him to actually spend. Knocking off 4 from the top will delay this problem from happening.

## Visas

### Statistics
|||
|-----------------|----------|
| DEX             |  18 → 16 |
| CON             |  12 → 10 |
| CHA             |  15 → 16 |
| Vitality (Base) | 24 → 48  |
| Force (Base)    | 18 → 36  |

### Feats
|||
|--------|---------------------|
| Remove | Two-Weapon Fighting |
| Remove | Critical Strike     |

### Force Powers
|||
|-----|------|
| Add | Slow |

### Explanation
Oh wow look it’s Bastila’s statline, how quaint.

In honesty, Bastila’s attributes fit Visas fairly well, and I have mostly kept them, save for removing some of her DEX to make her attributes actually match what they should be at her level. The main thing that needed to be done for Visas was a cleanup of her feats, powers and base stats. She has two more feats than she should, one less power than she should, and a LOT less base vitality/Force than she should.

I suspect the lack of base Force is meant to represent Nihilus’s predations upon her, and ditto the Vitality. I can understand this reasoning, but Visas is already the only Jedi companion in the entire game which doesn’t receive Force Sensitivity, and that already knocks 40 possible Force points off of her total; she doesn’t need to be savaged harder. Similarly, while I understand the reduced Vitality from the physical and indeed metaphysical trauma she’s suffered, I think that’s best represented with the CON reduction I gave her rather than with an arbitrary off-the-top reduction of her base vitality. This way her vitality is still reduced some, but it’s in a more usable range, and investments in her CON can represent her healing—both physical and mental—during her journey.

### Force Powers
|||
|-----|------|
| Add | Slow |


### Explanation
Inspired by offthegridmorty’s mod to do the same, we’ve decided to include an optional install to convert Visas to a Sith Assassin in this mod as well, because—well, it makes sense. She IS an assassin, and her status as a Sentinel in the basegame is not critical for party coverage; Atton becomes a Sentinel if converted to a Jedi, meaning that the class is not removed from your party if Visas is made an Assassin instead.

Aside from adjusting her feats to match the feat spread of an Assassin at her level, this module is no different from the changes made to the Sentinel version.
