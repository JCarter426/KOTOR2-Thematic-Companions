# Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions

## Atton

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| CON | 14 → 12 |
| CHA | 12 → 15 |

### Explanation
One of your first two companions, Atton, gains one more attribute point to bring CHA from 14 to 15, because he’s short 2 from what should’ve had at character creation.

### Explanation
This character needs a bit of a general rework. Their class is Soldier, and while I understand why Obsidian made it that way and have decided to keep it, a typical soldier’s statline doesn’t really fit their education or occupation. They’re a well-educated student employed by a government, not a supersoldier as their vanilla statline implies. One feat they shouldn’t have had was removed, while two additional were traded for feats which more closely fit their personality and training. Their attributes were also reworked to reflect their erudition and intuition. Some of their physical capabilities remain, because they’re clearly a field agent, but the emphasis is placed on the mental and not the physical.

|-----|--------|
| STR | 10 → 8 |

### Explanation
This character has too many feats, and their attributes are ludicrously inflated, but in this case aside from STR I’m not taking anything away from them; just like with T3-M4 in the original game, this is far-and-away the most situational and least-used companion, and they need all the help they can get as a party member.

### Skills

| Stealth      | 5 → 2 |
| Awareness    | 8 → 3 |
| Treat Injury | 8 → 2 |

### Explanation
I agree with all of this character’s vanilla attributes, except they had one more attribute point than they should’ve at their level. Their skills, however, are a different story. For a Soldier of their INT, they should have a total of 9 skill points. Instead, they had 27. This character gets savaged a bit here, because I do agree that, thematically, they needs some stealth. Their starting sustain takes a beating because of the Treat Injury reduction, but there’s still potential in there, especially later with changes to the character as the game progresses.

| Change | Armor Proficiency: Heavy → Armor Proficiency: Light |

### Explanation
This character has a very inflated statline for their level, but it isn’t quite so simple as that. Like Zalbaar from the first game, this character is not a basline humanoid; thus, as I interpret it, they share a similar +2 STR/+2 CON racial bonus. Proceeding from that baseline assumption, this character’s STR and CON have been reduced from 20 to 18 in both cases, which now leaves them at a normal starting attribute line (plus the +1 attribute selection at level 4, which they start at) when factoring in the assumed +2 STR/+2 CON racial bonus. Their skills are also slightly reshuffled, primarily to give him the stealth they should’ve had based on their backstory.

This character has lost Close Combat and gained Toughness both because I believe this better fits their character and because otherwise they would come at level 4 with two feats that could only be selected at level 4 (Improved Power Attack and Close Combat). This way they start with only feats they could have actually selected at their level.

|--------|----------------------|
| Remove | Power Blast          |
| Add    | Sniper Shot          |
| Add    | Improved Sniper Shot |

### Explanation
This character is another bipedal combat model like HK-47 from the original game, and suffers from the same sort of problem where so many of their attribute points are invested in STR and not stats they can actually use. But worse, everything else about them is also underbaked: they lack one feat due to the vanilla bug which flips combat and expert droid class feat gain; their base vitality is lower than it should be for their class; and they’re a full 11 skill points short of what their total should be!

This is a thematic mod, not a “make everybody good at what they do” mod, and this character is where I had to be the most judicious with this. They SHOULD be strong—droids don’t have human limitations—and as their construction is, let’s say, a bit ad hoc, their CON is also probably not that great. Yet at the same time it would be remiss to make this underutilized character even less serviceable as a companion.

This character is also treated as if they had an inherent racial bonus: a +6 to STR for being a bipedal droid. It’s realistic that they should be that strong, even if it’s not actively usable. Proceeding from here, I allocated some of the extra points that gave to CHA—yes, also useless for a droid, but they’re shown to be very charismatic. One point is left over from their level 4 level-up, and this I allocated to CON as a sort of olive branch; when the player levels them up to level 8, they can at least get them to 12 CON with the next attribute bonus.

However, I did what I could elsewhere to make them more serviceable. With their extra feat, I replaced Power Blast with Improved Sniper Shot, which is much more accurate to the character’s backstory, and also synergizes with lategame unique equipment. I also put their base vitality back where it should be so they have more health than they would in vanilla even without additional CON, and improved all of their skills, but with special focus on Repair so they can more easily keep themselves in the fight.

### Skills

| Stealth  | 5 → 6 |
| Security | 0 → 3 |

### Explanation
Kreia, your very first companion, is stupidly, comically strong. I was very torn about how to handle this for a variety of reasons, but I determined that thematic and logical consistency must be paramount in this mod. As such, Kreia got weedwhacked: attributes knocked down to what they should be for a level 3 consular, and her bonus base vitality nixed. I did allow her to keep one additional feat she shouldn’t technically have had (class skill: stealth) because she has a unique Force ability related to it, but other than that she is now perfectly in line with what a level 3 consular should have, stat-wise.

### Explanation
This character is a bit of another casualty of the thematic nature of this mod. They’re a bit aged, and they talk about how their body slowing down and getting more introspective in their old age, and while their stat line sort of reflects that, it’s not perfect.

To simulate their aging, I took their CON down by 1 level and applied the overage to WIS. They also have two more feats than they should, one of which I used on removing Toughness, to further represent their problems—perceived or real—with aging. The other was a reduction of Weapon Specialization: Blaster Rifle to Weapon Focus, just to make the feat count proper.

### Explanation
For some reason I’m unaware of, this character had Mission’s attributes from the original game, copied exactly. This shorted them pretty significantly; Mission herself is short on attributes, and this character also didn’t get the attribute they should’ve at level 4.

To remedy this and better represent this character’s… well, character, their Strength was pulled up to a respectable amount, and their level 4 attribute was considered to have been spent on CON—they are a bit rough-and-tumble. Their INT was reduced slightly, and some skills were reduced to make up the difference and to give them a basic stealth capability, which fits their character. Finally, they were given a small WIS boost up to a +1 modifier.

### Explanation
Yes, T3 returns! He has just slightly more skill points than he should for being level 3 at the start of the game—four, to be precise. It’s a minor enough fix, and actually will help with balance long-term due to some changes you can make to T3 over the course of the game.

### Explanation
Oh wow look it’s Bastila’s statline, how quaint.

In honesty, Bastila’s attributes fit this character fairly well, and I have mostly kept them, save for removing some of their DEX to make their attributes actually match what they should be at their level. The main thing that needed to be done here was a cleanup of feats, powers and base stats. The character has two more feats than they should, one less power than they should, and a LOT less base vitality/Force than they should.

I can’t go into my rationale for why Vitality/Force might’ve been reduced and what it may have been intended to represent for spoiler reasons, but suffice it to say the basic premise of the character having some limitations is retained just fine through other feat limitations and the CON reduction; the base vitality and Force didn’t need to be lowered to represent that.
